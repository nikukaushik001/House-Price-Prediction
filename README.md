# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts housing prices using a Linear Regression model. It was developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook and focuses on understanding the relationship between features like area, number of bedrooms, etc., and house prices.

## 📂 Files Included
- `House Price Prediction Linear Regression.ipynb` — Main notebook containing code and analysis
- `dataset.csv` — Dataset used for model training and testing

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **Data Import** – Load the housing dataset
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize relationships between features
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values and format data
4. **Model Building** – Train a Linear Regression model
5. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluate performance using metrics like R² score and RMSE
6. **Prediction** – Predict prices for test data

## 📈 Results
The Linear Regression model showed a strong correlation between independent variables (like area, number of rooms) and the target variable (price), giving an insight into how prices can be estimated using simple regression models.
